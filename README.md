# Whoa
A throttle/debounce library. Use it to time events and reduce server loads.

## Wait, _another_ one?
Yeah. These things are like birdhouses. Why do we build a birdhouse when there are billions out there? Because we can. There are many debounce and trottle libraries. This one is mine.

## Why would I use this one?
You shouldn’t. Go to lodash or something.
